# Polars Plugin segfault MCVE

There's a really small Polars plugin which sometimes segfaults.

How to reproduce:
- `cd polars-business`
- `make venv`
- `make install`
- `pytest` (run this one a few times)

This doesn't always segfault, just sometimes.

I just ran `pytest` 10 times, and it passed 4 times and segfaulted 6 times.

If I apply the following diff:
```diff
diff --git a/polars_business/polars_business/polars_business/__init__.py b/polars_business/polars_business/polars_business/__init__.py
index ebd9bbfaf..89b8c02b0 100644

then pytest always passes.

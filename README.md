# Polars Plugin segfault MCVE

There's a really small Polars plugin which sometimes segfaults.

How to reproduce:
- `cd polars-business`
- `make venv`
- `make install`
- `pytest` (run this one a few times)

This doesn't always segfault, just sometimes.

I just ran `pytest` 10 times, and it passed 4 times and segfaulted 6 times.
